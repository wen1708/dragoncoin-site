      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>DragonCoin (DRC) is a decentralized digital currency designed to empower communities through transparency, innovation, and shared growth. It aims to create a bridge between blockchain utility and cultural symbolism, inspired by the mythical power of the dragon as a force of prosperity and unity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Market Background</h2>
      <p>The global blockchain industry continues to expand rapidly, introducing new models of decentralized finance, NFT economies, and community-driven ecosystems. However, most projects struggle to sustain long-term growth due to lack of identity, utility, or transparent governance. DragonCoin addresses these issues by combining cultural storytelling with robust tokenomics and utility design.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Project Overview</h2>
      <p>DragonCoin’s ecosystem consists of three core pillars: the DRC token, NFT collectibles, and the DragonWorld platform. Together, they create a self-sustaining ecosystem where users can participate in governance, earn rewards, and contribute to ecosystem expansion.</p>
